 **Goal** : Can you predict whether people got H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines using information they shared about their     backgrounds, opinions, and health behaviors? Your goal is to predict how likely individuals are to receive their H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines. Specifically, you'll be predicting two probabilities: one for ```h1n1_vaccine``` and one for ```seasonal_vaccine```.
